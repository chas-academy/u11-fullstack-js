### You have to be logged in to be able to shop on the site. Please use these users downbelow or create your own one.

#### Admin user:

- email: brittsboemil@gmail.com
- password: changed

#### Regular user:

- email: emil.babra@chasacademy.se
- password: changed

### Things left to do:

- Add button in admin dashboard on mobile opens the addUser modal off screen very high up.
- Add error handling on all forms and queries. (Needs back-end fix to.)
- Fix so user is not forced to be logged in to shop. (If time, no requirment)(Maybe with cart in localstorage and send logged or not in state to back-end).

### Notes:

- When it comes to error handling, the reason it isn't there is because I created a GraphQL-API instead of a restAPI. This project that I've made with a restAPI has error handling: https://github.com/Babryz/Project-Manager
