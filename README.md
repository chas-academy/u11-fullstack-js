# RL ITEMS WEBSHOP

### Things left to do:

- Fix so cartpage doesnt need to be reloaded to fetch new items added.
- Fix so form-buttons don't need to be clicked twice to do what they're supposed to.
- Fix function for editing user through dashboard.
- Add function for checking if items is in cart and then change btn-text to "In Cart".
- Fix so buttons are always at the bottom of item boxes so they sync up.
- Add error handling on all forms. (Needs back-end fix to.)
- Fix so user is forced to be logged in to shop. (If time, no requirment)
